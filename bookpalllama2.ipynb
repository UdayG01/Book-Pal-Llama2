Despite appearances, though, \\nneither Camus nor Meursault ever tried to make things \\nsimple for themselves. Indeed, in the mind of a moralist, \\nsimplification is tantamount to immorality, and Meursault \\nand Camus are each moralists in their own way. What \\nlittle Meursault says or feels or does resonates with all he \\ndoes not say, all he does not feel, all he does not do. The \\n\"simplicity\" of the text is merely apparent and every\\xad\\nwhere paradoxical. \\nCamus acknowl edged employing an \"American \\nmethod\" in writing The Stranger, in the first half of the \\nbook in particular: the short, precise sentences; the \\ndepiction of a character ostensibly without consciousness; \\nand, in places, the \"tough guy\" tone. Heming way, Dos \\nPassos, Faulkner, Cain, and others had pointed the way. \\nThere is some irony then in the fact that for forty years \\nthe only translation available to American audiences \\nshould be Stuart Gilbert\\'s \"Britannic\" rendering. His \\nv ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='0 TR AN SL ATO R\\'S NOTE 0 \\nis the version we have all read, the version I read as a \\nschoolboy in the boondocks some twenty years ago. As \\nall translators do, Gilbert gave the novel a consistency \\nand voice all his own. A certain paraphrastic earnestness \\nmight be a way of describing his effort to make the text \\nintelligible, to help the English-speaking reader under\\xad\\nstand what Camus meant. In addition to giving the text \\na more \"American\" quality, I have also attempted to \\nventure farther into the letter of Camus\\'s novel, to \\ncapture what he said and how he said it, not what he \\nmeant. In theory, the latter should take care of itself. \\nWhen Meursault meets old Salamano and his dog in \\nthe dark stairwell of their apartment house, Meursault \\nobserves, \"Il etait avec son chien.\" \\\\iVith the re8ex of a \\nwell-bred Englishm an, Gilbert restores the conventional \\nrelation between man and beast and gives additional \\nadverbial information: \"As usual, he had his dog with \\nhim.\" But I have taken Meursault at his word: \"He was \\nwith his dog.\"-in the way one is with a spouse or a \\nfriend. A sentence as straightf orward as this gives us the \\nworld through Meursault\\'s eyes. As he says toward the \\nend of his story, as he sees things, Salamano\\'s dog was \\nworth just as much as Salamano\\'s wife. Such peculiarities \\nof perception, such psychological increments of character \\nare Meursault. It is by pursuing what is unconventional \\nin Camus\\'s writing that one approaches a degree of its \\nstill startling originality. \\nIn the second half of the novel Camus gives freer \\nrein to a lyricism which is his alone as he takes Meursault, \\nnow stripped of his liberty, beyond sensation to enforced \\nvi ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='0 TR ANS LATOR \\'S NO TE 0 \\nmemory, unsatisfied desire and, finally, to a kind of \\nunderstanding. In this stylistic difference between the \\ntwo parts, as everywhere, an impossible fidelity has been \\nmy purpose. \\nNo sentence in French literature in English trans\\xad\\nlation is better known than the opening sentence of The \\nStranger. It has become a sacred cow of sorts, and I have \\nchanged it. In his notebooks Camus recorded the obser\\xad\\nvation that \"the curious feeling the son has for his mother \\nconstitutes all his sensibility.\" And Sartre, in his \"Ex\\xad\\nplication de L\\'Etmnger,\" goes out of his way to point out \\nMeursault\\'s use of the child\\'s word \"Maman\" when \\nspeaking of his mother. To use the more removed, adult \\n\"Mother\" is, I believe, to change the nature of Meursault\\'s \\ncurious feeling for her. It is to change his very sensibility. \\nAs Richard Howard pointed out in his classic state\\xad\\nment on retranslation in his prefatory note to The Im\\xad\\nmoralist, time reveals all translation to be paraphrase. All \\ntranslations date; certain works do not. Knowing this, \\nand with a certain nostalgia, I bow in Stuart Gilbert\\'s \\ndirection and ask, as Camus once did, for indulgence and \\nunderstanding from the reader of this first American \\ntranslation of The Stranger, which I affectionately dedi\\xad\\ncate to Karel Wahrsager. \\nThe special circumstances under which this transla\\xad\\ntion was completed require that I thank my editor at \\nKnopf, Judith Jones, for years of patience and faith. \\nNancy Festinger and Melissa Weissberg also deserve my \\ngratitude. \\nvii ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='PART ONE ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='1 \\nMaman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don\\'t know. \\nI got a telegram from the home: \"Mother deceased . \\nFuneral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.\" That doesn\\'t mean \\nanything.

That way I can be there for the \\nvigil and come back tomorrow night. I asked my boss for \\ntwo days off and there was no way he was going to re\\xad\\nfuse me with an excuse like that. But he wasn\\'t too \\nhappy about it. I even said, \"It\\'s not my fault.\" He didn\\'t \\nsay anything.

I \\nwas a little distracted because I still had to go up to \\nEmmanuel\\'s place to borrow a black tie and an arm band. \\nHe lost his uncle a few months back. \\nI ran so as not to miss the bus. It was probably be\\xad\\ncause of all the rushing around, and on top of that the \\nbumpy ride, the smell of gasoline, and the glare of the \\nsky and the road, that I dozed off. I slept almost \\nthe whole way. And when I woke up, I was slumped \\nagainst a soldier who smiled at me and asked if I\\'d been \\ntraveling long. I said, \"Yes,\" just so I wouldn\\'t have to \\nsay anything else. \\nThe home is two kilometers from the village. I walked \\nthem. I wanted to see Maman right away. But the care\\xad\\ntaker told me I had to see the director first. He was busy, \\nso I waited awhile. The caretaker talked the whole time \\nand then I saw the director. I was shown into his office. \\nHe was a little old man with the ribbon of the Legion \\nof Honor in his lapel. He looked at me with his clear \\neyes. Then he shook my hand and held it so long I \\ndidn\\'t know how to get it loose. He thumbed through \\na file and said, \"Madame Meursault came to us three \\nyears ago. You were her sole support.\" I thought he was \\ncriticizing me for something and I started to explain. \\nBut he cut me off. \"You don\\'t have to justify yourself, \\nmy dear boy. I\\'ve read your mother\\'s file. You weren\\'t \\nable to provide for her properly. She needed someone to \\nlook after her. You earn only a modest salary. And the \\ntruth of the matter is, she was happier here.\" I said, \\n4 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='o THE ST RANGER 0 \\n\"Yes, sir.\" He added, \"You see, she had friends here, \\npeople her own age. She was able to share things from \\nthe old days with them. You\\'re young, and it must have \\nbeen hard for her with you.\" \\nIt was true. When she was at home with me, Maman \\nused to spend her time following me with her eyes, not \\nsaying a thing. For the first few days she was at the home \\nshe cried a lot. But that was because she wasn\\'t used to \\nit. A few months later and she would have cried if she\\'d \\nbeen taken out. She was used to it. That\\'s partly why I \\ndidn\\'t go there much this past year. And also because it \\ntook up my Sunday-not to mention the trouble of \\ngetting to the bus, buying tickets, and spending two hours \\ntraveling. \\nThe director spoke to me again. But I wasn\\'t really \\nlistening anymore. Then he said, \"I suppose you\\'d like \\nto see your mother.\" I got up without saying anything \\nand he led the way to the door. On the way downstairs, he \\nexplained, \"We\\'ve moved her to our little mortuary. So \\nas not to upset the others. Whenever one of the residents \\ndies, the others are a bit on edge for the next two or \\nthree days. And that makes it difficult to care for them.\" \\nWe crossed a courtyard where there were lots of old \\npeople chatting in little groups. As we went by, the talk\\xad\\ning would stop. And then the conversation would start \\nup again behind us. The sound was like the muffied \\njabber of parakeets. The director stopped at the door of \\na small building. \\'\\'I\\'ll leave you now, Monsieur Meur\\xad\\nsault. If you need me for anything, I\\'ll be in my office. \\n5 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGER 0 \\nAs is usually the case, the funeral is set for ten o\\'clock in \\nthe morning. This way you\\'ll be able to keep vigil over \\nthe departed. One last thing: it seems your mother \\noften expressed to her friends her desire for a religious \\nburial. I\\'ve taken the liberty of making the necessar y \\narrangements. But I wanted to let you know.\" I thanked \\nhim. While not an atheist, Maman had never in her life \\ngiven a thought to religion. \\nI went in. It was a very bright, whitewashed room \\nwith a skylight for a roof. The furniture consisted of \\nsome chairs and some cross-shaped sawhorses. Two of \\nthem, in the middle of the room, were supporting a \\nclosed casket. All you could see were some shiny screws, \\nnot screwed down all the way, standing out against the \\nwalnut-stained planks. Near the casket was an Arab \\nnurse in a white smock, with a brightly colored scarf on \\nher head. \\nJust then the caretaker came in behind me. He must \\nhave been running. He stuttered a little. \"We put the \\ncover on, but I\\'m supposed to unscrew the casket so you \\ncan see her.\" He was moving toward the casket when I \\nstopped him. He said, \"You don\\'t want to?\" I answered, \\n\"No.\" He was quiet, and I was embarrassed because I \\nfelt I shouldn\\'t have said that. He looked at me and then \\nasked, \"Why not?\" but without criticizing, as if he just \\nwanted to know. I said, \"I don\\'t know.\" He started twirl\\xad\\ning his moustache, and then without looking at me, again \\nhe said, \"I understand.\" He had nice pale blue eyes and \\na reddish complexi on. He offered me a chair and then \\n6 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 15}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGER 0 \\nsat down right behind me. The nurse stood up and went \\ntoward the door. At that point the caretaker said to me, \\n\"She\\'s got an abscess.\" I didn\\'t understand , so I looked \\nover at the nurse and saw that she had a bandage \\nwrapped around her head just below the eyes. Where \\nher nose should have been, the bandage was Bat. All \\nyou could see of her face was the whiteness of the ban\\xad\\ndage. \\nWhen she\\'d gone, the caretaker said, \\'\\'I\\'ll leave you \\nalone.\" I don\\'t know what kind of gesture I made, but \\nhe stayed where he was, behind me. Having this presence \\nbreathing down my neck was starting to annoy me. The \\nroom was filled with beautiful late-afternoon sunlight. \\nTwo hornets were buzzing against the glass roof. I \\ncould feel myself getting sleepy. Without turning around, \\nI said to the caretaker, \"Have you been here long?\" \\nRight away he answered, \"Five years\"-as if he\\'d been \\nwaiting all along for me to ask. \\nAfter that he did a lot of talking. He would have been \\nvery surprised if anyone had told him he would end up \\ncaretaker at the Marengo home. He was sixty-four and \\ncame from Paris. At that point I interrupted him. \"Oh, \\nyou\\'re not from around here?\" Then I remembered that \\nbefore taking me to the director\\'s office, he had talked \\nto me about Maman. He\\'d told me that they had to \\nbury her quickly, because it gets hot in the plains, espe\\xad\\ncially in this part of the country. That was when he told \\nme he had lived in Paris and that he had found it hard \\nto forget it. In Paris they keep vigil over the body for \\n7 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANG ER 0 \\nthree, sometimes four days. But here you barely have \\ntime to get used to the idea before you have to start \\nrunning after the hearse. Then his wife had said to him, \\n\"Hush now, that\\'s not the sort of thing to be telling the \\ngentlem an.\" The old man had blushed and apologized. \\nI\\'d stepped in and said, \"No, not at all.\" I thought what \\nhe\\'d been saying was interesting and made sense. \\nIn the little mortuary he told me that he\\'d come to \\nthe horne because he was destitute. He was in good \\nhealth, so he\\'d offered to take on the job of caretaker. I \\npointed out that even so he was still a resident. He said \\nno, he wasn\\'t. I\\'d already been struck by the way he \\nhad of saying \"they\" or \"the others\" and, less often, \"the \\nold people,\" talking about the patients, when some of \\nthem weren\\'t any older than he was. But of course it \\nwasn\\'t the same. He was the caretaker, and to a certain \\nextent he had authority over them. \\nJust then the nurse carne in. Night had fallen sud\\xad\\ndenly. Darkness had gathered, quickly, above the sky\\xad\\nlight. The caretaker turned the switch and I was blinded \\nby the sudden Bash of light. He suggested I go to the \\ndining hall for dinner. But I wasn\\'t hungry. Then he \\noffered to bring me a cup of coffee with milk. I like milk \\nin my coffee, so I said yes, and he carne back a few \\nminutes later with a tray. I drank the coffee. Then I felt \\nlike having a smoke. But I hesitated, because I didn\\'t \\nknow if I could do it with Marnan right there. I thought \\nabout it; it didn\\'t matter. I offered the caretaker a ciga\\xad\\nrette and we smoked. \\n8 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nAt one point he said, \"You know, your mother\\'s \\nfriends will be coming to keep vigil too. It\\'s customary. \\nI have to go get some chairs and some black coffee.\" I \\nasked him if he could tum off one of the lights. The \\nglare on the white walls was making me drowsy. He said \\nhe couldn\\'t. That was how they\\'d been wired: it was all \\nor nothing. I didn\\'t pay too much attention to him after \\nthat. He left, came back, set up some chairs. On one of \\nthem he stacked some cups around a coffee pot. Then \\nhe sat down across from me, on the other side of Maman. \\nThe nurse was on that side of the room too, but with\\' \\nher back to me. I couldn\\'t see what she was doing. But \\nthe way her arms were moving made me think she was \\nknitting. It was pleasant; the coffee had warmed me \\nup, and the smell of Rowers on the night air was coming \\nthrough the open door. I think I dozed off for a while. \\nIt was a rustling sound that woke me up. Because \\nI\\'d had my eyes closed, the whiteness of the room seemed \\neven brighter than before. There wasn\\'t a shadow any\\xad\\nwhere in front of me, and every object, every angle and \\ncurve stood out so sharply it made my eyes hurt. That\\'s \\nwhen Maman\\'s friends came in.

I \\nsaw them more clearly than I had ever seen anyone, and \\nnot one detail of their faces or their clothes escaped me. \\nBut I couldn\\'t hear them, and it was hard for me to be\\xad\\nlieve they really existed.

I'd never noticed what huge stomachs \\nold women can have. Almost all the men were skinny \\nand carried canes. What struck me most about their \\nfaces was that I couldn't see their eyes, just a faint \\nglimmer in a nest of wrinkles. When they'd sat down, \\nmost of them looked at me and nodded awkwardly, their \\nlips sucked in by their toothless mouths, so that I couldn't \\ntell if they were greeting me or if it was just a nervous \\ntic. I think they were greeting me. It was then that I \\nrealized they were all sitting across from me, nodding \\ntheir heads, grouped around the caretaker. For a second \\nI had the ridiculous feeling that they were there to judge \\nme. \\nSoon one of the women started crying. She was in \\nthe second row, hidden behind one of her companions, \\nand I couldn't see her very well. She was crying softly, \\nsteadily, in little sobs. I thought she'd never stop. The \\nothers seemed not to hear her. They sat there hunched \\nup, gloomy and silent. They would look at the casket, \\nor their canes, or whatever else, but that was all they \\nwould look at. The woman kept on crying. It surprised \\nme, because I didn't know who she was. I wished I \\ndidn't have to listen to her anymore. But I didn't dare \\nsay anything. The caretaker leaned over and said some\\xad\\nthing to her, but she shook her head, mumbled some\\xad\\nthing, and went on crying as much as before. Then the \\ncaretaker came around to my side. He sat down next to \\nme. After a long pause he explained, without looking at \\n10 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='o THE STRANGER 0 \\nme, \"She was very close to your mother. She says your \\nmother was her only friend and now she hasn\\'t got any-\\n\" one. \\nWe just sat there like that for quite a while. The \\nwoman\\'s sighs and sobs were quieting down. She sniffled \\na lot. Then finally she shut up. I didn\\'t feel drowsy \\nanymore, but I was tired and my back was hurting me. \\nNow it was all these people not making a sound that \\nwas getting on my nerves. Except that every now and \\nthen I\\'d hear a strange noise and I couldn\\'t figure out \\nwhat it was. Finally I realized that some of the old \\npeople were sucking at the insides of their cheeks and \\nmaking these weird smacking noises. They were so lost \\nin their thoughts that they weren\\'t even aware of it. I \\neven had the impression that the dead woman lying in \\nfront of them didn\\'t mean anything to them.

He gave the order into \\nthe telephone, lowering his voice: \"Figeac, tell the men \\nthey can go ahead.\" \\nAfter that he told me he would be attending the \\nfuneral and I thanked him. He sat down behind his desk \\nand crossed his short legs. He informed me that he and \\nI would be the only ones there, apart from the nurse on \\nduty. The residents usually weren\\'t allowed to attend \\nfunerals. He only let them keep the vigil. \"It\\'s more \\nhumane that way,\" he remarked.

He\\'s early.\" He warned me that it would take at ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nleast three-quarters of an hour to walk to the church, \\nwhich is in the village itself. We went downstairs. Out \\nin front of the building stood the priest and two altar \\nboys. One of them was holding a censer, and the priest \\nwas leaning toward him, adjusting the length of its silver \\nchain. As we approached, the priest straightened up. He \\ncalled me \"my son\" and said a few words to me. He went \\ninside; I followed. \\nI noticed right away that the screws on the casket \\nhad been tightened and that there were four men wear\\xad\\ning black in the room.

The men moved \\ntoward the casket with a pall. The priest, his acolytes, the \\ndirector and I all went outside. A woman I didn\\'t know \\nwas standing by the door. \"Monsieur Meursault,\" the \\ndirector said. I didn\\'t catch the woman\\'s name; I just \\nunderstood that she was the nurse assigned by the home. \\nWithout smiling she lowered her long, gaunt face. Then \\nwe stepped aside to make way for the body. We fol\\xad\\nlowed the pall bearers and left the horne. Outside the \\ngate stood the hearse. Varnished, glossy, and oblong, it \\nreminded me of a pencil box. Next to it was the funeral \\ndirector, a little man in a ridiculous getup, and an awk\\xad\\nward, embarrassed-looking old man. I realized that it was \\nMonsieur Perez. He was wearing a soft felt hat with a \\nround crown and a wide brim (he took it off as the \\ncasket was coming through the gate), a suit with trousers ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nthat were corkscrewed down around his ankles, and a \\nblack tie with a knot that was too small for the big white \\ncollar of his shirt. His lips were trembling below a nose \\ndotted with blackheads. Strange, floppy, thick-rimmed \\nears stuck out through his fine, white hair, and I was \\nstruck by their blood-red color next to the pallor of his \\nface. The funeral director assigned us our places. First \\ncame the priest, then the hearse. Flanking it, the four \\nmen. Behind it, the director and myself and, bringing up \\nthe rear, the nurse and Monsieur Perez. \\nThe sky was already filled with light. The sun was \\nbeginning to bear down on the earth and it was getting \\nhotter by the minute. I don't know why we waited so \\nlong before getting under way. I was hot in my dark \\nclothes. The little old man, who had put his hat back on, \\ntook it off again. I turned a little in his direction and \\nwas looking at him when the director started talking to \\nme about him. He told me that my mother and Monsieur \\nPerez often used to walk down to the village together in \\nthe evenings, accompanied by a nurse. I was looking at \\nthe countryside around me. Seeing the rows of cypress \\ntrees leading up to the hills next to the sky, and the \\nhouses standing out here and there against that red \\nand green earth, I was able to understand Maman better. \\nEvenings in that part of the country must have been a \\nkind of sad relief. But today, with the sun bearing down, \\nmaking the whole landscape shimmer with heat, it was in\\xad\\nhuman and oppressive. \\nWe got under way. It was then that I noticed that \\n15 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nPerez had a slight limp. Little by little, the hearse was \\npicking up speed and the old man was losing ground. \\nOne of the men Banking the hearse had also dropped \\nback and was now even with me. I was surprised at \\nhow fast the sun was climbing in the sky. I noticed that \\nfor quite some time the countryside had been buzzing \\nwith the sound of insects and the crackling of grass. The \\nsweat was pouring down my face. I wasn\\'t wearing a \\nhat, so I fanned myself with my handkerchief. The man \\nfrom the undertaker\\'s said something to me then which \\nI missed. He was lifting the edge of his cap with his \\nright hand and wiping his head with a handkerchief \\nwith his left at the same time. I said, \"What?\" He pointed \\nup at the sky and repeated, \"Pretty hot.\" I said, \"Yes.\" \\nA minute later he asked, \"Is that your mother in there?\" \\nAgain I said, \"Yes.\" \"Was she old?\" I answered, \"Fairly,\" \\nbecause I didn\\'t know the exact number. After that he \\nwas quiet. I turned around and saw old Perez about fifty \\nmeters behind us. He was going as fast as he could, swing\\xad\\ning his felt hat at the end of his arm. I looked at the \\ndirector, too. He was walking with great dignity, without \\na single wasted motion. A few beads of sweat were form\\xad\\ning on his forehead, but he didn\\'t wipe them off. \\nThe procession seemed to me to be moving a little \\nfaster. All around me there was still the same glowing \\ncountryside Hooded with sunlight. The glare from the \\nsky was unbearable. At one point, we went over a section \\nof the road that had just been repaved. The tar had \\nburst open in the sun. Our feet sank into it, leaving its \\nr6 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRA NGER 0 \\nshiny pulp exposed. Sticking up above the top of the \\nhearse, the coachman\\'s hard leather hat looked as if it \\nhad been molded out of the same black mud. I felt a \\nlittle lost between the blue and white of the sky and the \\nmonotony of the colors around me-the sticky black of \\nthe tar, the dull black of all the clothes, and the shiny \\nblack of the hearse. All of it-the sun, the smell of leather \\nand horse dung from the hearse, the smell of varnish and \\nincense, and my fatigue after a night without sleep-was \\nmaking it hard for me to see or think straight. I turned \\naround again: Perez seemed to be way back there, fading \\nin the shimmering heat. Then I lost sight of him alto\\xad\\ngether. I looked around and saw that he\\'d left the road \\nand cut out across the fields. I also noticed there was a \\nbend in the road up ahead. I realized that Perez, who \\nknew the country, was taking a short cut in order to catch \\nup with us. By the time we rounded the bend, he was \\nback with us. Then we lost him again. He set off cross \\ncountry once more, and so it went on. I could feel the \\nblood pounding in my temples. \\nAfter that, everything seemed to happen so fast, so \\ndeliberately, so naturally that I don\\'t remember any of \\nit anymore. Except for one thing: as we entered the \\nvillage, the nurse spoke to me. She had a remarkable \\nvoice which didn\\'t go with her face at all, a melodious, \\nquavering voice.

He had on a straw hat and a bow tie and was \\ncarrying a walking stick. Seeing him with his wife, I \\nunderstood why people in the neighborhood said he was \\ndistinguished.

I \\nthought they must be heading to the movies in town. \\nThat was why they were leaving so early and hurrying \\ntoward the streetcar, laughing loudly. \\nAfter them, the street slowly emptied out. The \\nmatinees had all started, I guess. The only ones left were \\nthe shopkeepers and the cats. The sky was clear but dull \\nabove the fig trees lining the street.

Gradually, though, it \\n22 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 31}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R o \\ncleared up again. But the passing clouds had left a hint \\nof rain hanging over the street, which made it look \\ndarker.

One of \\nthem even yelled up to me, \"We beat \\'em!\" And I \\nnodded, as if to say \"Yes.\" From then on there was a \\nsteady stream of cars. \\nThe sky changed again. Above the rooftops the sky \\nhad taken on a reddish glow, and with evening coming \\non the streets came to life. People were straggling back \\nfrom their walks.

But they hung around \\nanyway, walking up and down the sidewalk across the \\nstreet.

The young men had made sure they would have \\nto bump right into them and then they would make \\ncracks.

He said, \"So you \\nsee, I wasn\\'t the one who started it. He was asking for \\nit.\" It was true and I agreed.

I \\ndidn\\'t say anything, and he asked me again if I wanted \\nto be pals. I said it was fine with me: he seemed pleased. \\nHe got out the blood sausage, fried it up, and set out \\nglasses, plates, knives and forks, and two bottles of wine. \\nAll this in silence. Then we sat down. As we ate, he \\nstarted telling me his story. He \\'>vas a little hesitant at \\nfirst. \"I knew this lady ... as a matter of fact, well, she \\nwas my mistress .\" The man he\\'d had the fight with was \\nthis woman\\'s brother. He told me he\\'d been keeping \\nher. I didn\\'t say anything, and yet right away he added \\nthat he knew what people around the neighborhood \\n29 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='o THE STRANGER 0 \\nwere saying, but that his conscience was clear and that \\nhe was a warehouse guard. \\n\\'To get back to what I was saying,\" he continued, \\n\"I realized that she was cheating on me.\" He\\'d been \\ngiving her just enough to live on. He paid the rent on \\nher room and gave her twenty francs a day for food. \\n\"Three hundred francs for the room, six hundred for \\nfood, a pair of stockings every now and then-th at made \\nit a thousand francs. And Her Highness refused to work. \\nBut she was always telling me that things were too tight, \\nthat she couldn\\'t get by on what I was giving her. And \\nI\\'d say to her, \\'Why not work half-days? You\\'d be helping \\nme out on all the little extras. I bought you a new outfit \\njust this month, I give you twenty francs a day, I pay \\nyour rent, and what do you do? ... You have coffee in \\nthe afternoons with your friends. You even provide the \\ncoffee and sugar. And me, I provide the money. I\\'ve been \\ngood to you, and this is how you repay me.\\' But she \\nwouldn\\'t work; she just kept on telling me she couldn\\'t \\nmake ends meet-and that\\'s what made me realize she \\nwas cheating on me.\" \\nThen he told me that he\\'d found a lottery ticket in \\nher purse and she hadn\\'t been able to explain how she \\npaid for it. A short time later he\\'d found a ticket from the \\nshop in Mont-de-Piet e in her room which proved that \\nshe\\'d pawned two bracelets. Until then he hadn\\'t even \\nknown the bracelets existed. \"It was clear that she was \\ncheating on me. So I left her. But first I smacked her \\naround.

I told her that all she was interested in was getting \\ninto the sack.

He stopped to adjust the lamp\\'s wick, \\nwhich was smoking. I just listened. I\\'d drunk close to a \\nliter of wine and my temples were burning. I was \\nsmoking Raymond\\'s cigarett es because I\\'d run out. The \\nlast streetcars were going by, taking the now distant \\nsounds of the neighborhood with them. Raymond went \\non. What bothered him was that he \"still had sexual \\nfeelings for her.\" But he wanted to punish her. First \\nhe\\'d thought of taking her to a hotel and calling the \\nvice squad to cause a scandal and have her listed as a \\ncommon prostitute. After that he\\'d looked up some of his \\nunderworld friends. But they didn\\'t come up with any\\xad\\nthing. As Raymond pointed out to me, a lot of good it \\ndoes being in the underworld. He\\'d said the same thing \\nto them, and then they\\'d suggested \"marking\" her. But \\nthat wasn\\'t what he wanted. He was going to think \\nabout it. But first he wanted to ask me someth ing.

I said I didn\\'t think anything but \\nthat it was interesting. He asked if I thought she was \\ncheating on him, and it seemed to me she was; if I \\nthought she should be punished and what I would do \\nin his place, and I said you can\\'t ever be sure, but I \\nunderstood his wanting to punish her. I drank a little \\nmore wine. He lit a cigarette and let me in on what he \\nwas thinking about doing. He wanted to write her a \\nletter, \"one with a punch and also some things in it to \\nmake her sorry for what she\\'s done.\" Then, when she \\ncarne running back, he\\'d go to bed with her and \"right \\nat the last minute\" he\\'d spit in her face and throw her \\nout. Yes, that would punish her, I thought. But Ray\\xad\\nmond told me he didn\\'t think he could write the kind \\nof letter it would take and that he\\'d thought of asking \\nme to write it for him. Since I didn\\'t say anything, he \\nasked if I\\'d mind doing it right then and I said no. \\nHe downed a glass of wine and then stood up. He \\npushed aside the plates and the little bit of cold sausage \\nwe\\'d left. He carefully wiped the oilcloth covering the \\ntable. Then from a drawer in his night table he took out \\na sheet of paper, a yellow envelope, a small red pen box, \\nand a square bottle with purple ink in it. When he told \\nme the woman\\'s name I realized she was Moorish. I \\nwrote the letter. I did it just as it came to me, but I \\ntried my best to please Raymond because I didn\\'t have \\nany reason not to please him. Then I read it out loud. He \\nlistened, smoking and nodding his head; then he asked ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 41}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nme to read it again. He was very pleased. He said, \"I \\ncould tell you knew about these things.\" I didn\\'t notice \\nat first, but he had stopped calling me \"monsieur.\" It \\nwas only when he announced \"Now you\\'re a pal, \\nl\\\\lleursault\" and said it again that it struck me. He re· \\npeated his remark and I said, \"Yes.\" I didn\\'t mind being \\nhis pal, and he seemed set on it. He sealed the letter \\nand we finished off the wine. Then we sat and smoked \\nfor a while without saying anything. Outside, every· \\nthing was quiet; we heard the sound of a car passing. I \\nsaid, \"It\\'s late.\" Raymond thought so too. He remarked \\nhow quickly the time passed, and in a way it was true. \\nI felt sleepy, but it was hard for me to get up. I must \\nhave looked tired, because Raymond told me not to let \\nthings get to me. At first I didn\\'t understand. Then he \\nexplained that he\\'d heard about l\\\\llaman\\'s death but \\nthat it was one of those things that was bound to happen \\nsooner or later. I thought so too. \\nI got up. Raymond gave me a very firm hand shake \\nand said that men always understand each other. I left \\nhis room, closing the door behind me, and paused for a \\nminute in the dark, on the landing. The house was \\nquiet, and a breath of dark, dank air wafted up from \\ndeep in the stairwell. All I could hear was the blood \\npounding in my ears. I stood there, motionless.

I\\'d left my \\nwindow open, and the summer night air Rowing over \\nour brown bodies felt good. \\nThat morning Marie stayed and I told her that we \\nwould have lunch together. I went downstairs to buy \\nsome meat. On my way back upstairs I heard a woman\\'s \\nvoice in Raymond\\'s room. A little later old Salamano \\ngrowled at his dog; we heard the sound of footsteps and \\nclaws on the wooden stairs and then \"Lousy, stinking \\nbastard\" and they went down into the street.

I\\'ll teach \\nyou to use me.\" There were some thuds and the woman \\nscreamed, but in such a terrifying way that the landing \\n35 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 44}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nimmedia tely filled with people. Marie and I went to see, \\ntoo. The woman was still shrieking and Raymond was \\nstill hitting her. Marie said it was terrible and I didn\\'t \\nsay anything. She asked me to go find a policeman, but \\nI told her I didn\\'t like cops. One showed up anyway with \\nthe tenant from the third floor, who\\'s a plumber. The \\ncop knocked on the door and we couldn\\'t hear anything \\nanymore. He knocked harder and after a minute the \\nwoman started crying and Raymond opened the door. \\nHe had a cigarette in his mouth and an innocent look on \\nhis face.

Raymond told him. \"Take that cigarette \\nout of your mouth when you\\'re talking to me,\" the cop \\nsaid. Raymond hesitated, looked at me, and took a drag \\non his cigarette. Right then the cop slapped him-a \\nthick, heavy smack right across the face. The cigarette \\nwent flying across the landing. The look on Raymond\\'s \\nface changed, but he didn\\'t say anything for a minute, \\nand then he asked, in a meek voice, if he could pick up \\nhis cigarette.

He also said that Raymond ought to be \\nashamed to be so drunk that he\\'d have the shakes like \\nthat.

So we took our \\ntime getting back, him telling me how glad he was that \\nhe\\'d been able to give the woman what she deserved. I \\nfound him very friendly with me and I thought it was a \\nnice moment. \\nFrom a distance I noticed old Salarnano standing on \\nthe doorstep. He looked flustered. When we got closer, \\nI saw that he didn\\'t have his dog. He was looking all \\nover the place, turning around, peering into the darkness \\nof the entryway, muttering incoherently, and then he \\nstarted searching the street again with his little red eyes. \\nWhen Raymond asked him what was wrong,, he didn\\'t \\nanswer right away. I barely heard him mumble \"Stink\\xad\\ning bastard,\" and he went on fidgeting around. I asked \\nhim where his dog was. He snapped at me and said he \\nwas gone.

I stopped to watch The King of the Escape \\nArtists.\\' And when I was ready to go, he wasn\\'t there. \\nSure, I\\'ve been meaning to get him a smaller collar for \\na long time. But I never thought the bastard would take \\noff like that.\" \\nThen Raymond pointed out to him that the dog \\nmight have gotten lost and that he would come back. \\nHe gave examples of dogs that had walked dozens of \\nkilometers to get back to their masters. Nevertheless, the ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 47}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R o \\nold man looked even more flustered. \"But they\\'ll take \\nhim away from me, don\\'t you see? If only somebody \\nwould take him in. But that\\'s impossible -everyb ody\\'s \\ndisgusted by his scabs. The police\\'ll get him for sure.\" \\nSo I told him he should go to the pound and they\\'d give \\nthe dog back to him after he paid a fee. He asked me if \\nit was a big fee. I didn\\'t know.

He was planning to \\nopen an office in Paris which would handle his business \\ndirectly with the big companies, on the spot, and he \\nwanted to know how I felt about going there.

Then he asked me \\nif I wasn\\'t interested in a change of life. I said that peo\\xad\\nple never change their lives, that in any case one life was \\nas good as another and that I wasn\\'t dissatisfied with \\nmine here at all. He looked upset and told me that I \\nnever gave him a straight answer, that I had no ambition, \\nand that that was disastrous in business. So I went back \\nto work. I would rather not have upset him, but I \\ncouldn\\'t see any reason to change my life. Looking back \\non it, I wasn\\'t unhappy. When I was a student, I had \\nlots of ambitions like that.

But he had ended \\nup working on the railroads, and he didn't regret it, \\nbecause now he had a small pension. He hadn't been \\nhappy with his wife, but he'd pretty much gotten used \\nto her. When she died he had been very lonely. So he \\nasked a shop buddy for a dog and he'd gotten this one \\nvery young. He'd had to feed it from a bottle.

But he \\nwas a good dog just the same.\" I said he was well bred \\nand Salamano looked pleased. \"And,\" he added, \"you \\ndidn\\'t know him before he got sick.

I could tell he liked her, but she hardly \\nsaid anything to him. Every once in a while she'd look at \\nhim and laugh. \\nWe got off in the outskirts of Algiers. The beach \\nwasn't far from the bus stop. But we had to cross a small \\nplateau which overlooks the sea and then drops steeply \\ndown to the beach. It was covered with yellowish rocks \\nand the whitest asphodels set against the already hard \\nblue of the sky. Marie was having fun scattering the \\npetals, taking big swipes at them with her oilcloth bag. \\nWe walked between rows of small houses behind green \\nor white fences, some with their verandas hidden be\\xad\\nhind the tamarisks, others standing naked among the \\nrocks. Before we reached the edge of the plateau, we \\ncould already see the motionless sea and, farther out, a \\nmassive, drowsy-looking promon tory in the clear water. \\nThe faint hum of a motor rose up to us in the still air. \\nAnd way off, we saw a tiny trawler moving, almost im\\xad\\nperceptibly, across the dazzling sea. Marie gathered \\nsome rock irises. From the slope leading down to the \\nbeach, we could see that there were already some people \\nswimming. \\nRaymond's friend lived in a little wooden bungalow \\nat the far end of the beach. The back of the house \\nrested up against the rocks, and the pilings that held it \\nup in front went straight down into the water. Raymond \\nintroduced us. His friend's name was Masson. He was a \\nbig guy, very tall and broad-sh ouldered, with a plump, \\nsweet little wife with a Parisian accent. Right off he told \\n49 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 58}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nus to make ourselves at horne and said that his wife had \\njust fried up some fish he\\'d caught that morning. I told \\nhim how nice I thought his house was. He told me that \\nhe spent Saturdays and Sundays and all his days off \\nthere. \"With my wife, of course,\" he added. Just then \\nhis wife was laughing with Marie. For the first time \\nmaybe, I really thought I was going to get married. \\nMasson wanted to go for a swim, but his wife and \\nRaymond didn\\'t want to come. The three of us went \\ndown to the beach and Marie jumped right in. Masson \\nand I waited a little. He spoke slowly, and I noticed \\nthat he had a habit of finishing everything he said with \\n\"and I\\'d even say,\" when really it didn\\'t add anything to \\nthe meaning of his sentence. Referring to Marie, he \\nsaid, \"She\\'s stunning, and I\\'d even say charming.\" After \\nthat I didn\\'t pay any more attention to this mannerism \\nof his, because I was absorbed by the feeling that the \\nsun was doing me a lot of good. The sand was starting \\nto get hot underfoot. I held back the urge to get into the \\nwater a minute longer, but finally I said to Masson , \\n\"Shall we?\" I dove in. He waded in slowly and started \\nswimming only when he couldn\\'t touch bottom anymore. \\nHe did the breast stroke, and not too well, either, so I \\nleft him and joined Marie. The water was cold and I was \\nglad to be swimming.

We saw Masson making \\nhis way back to the beach to stretch out in the sun. \\nFrom far away he looked huge. Marie wanted us to \\nswim together. I got behind her to hold her around \\nthe waist. She used her arms to move us forward and \\nI did the kicking. The little splashing sound followed \\nus through the morning air until I got tired. I left \\nMarie and headed back, swimming smoothly and breath\\xad\\ning easily. On the beach I stretched out on my stomach \\nalongside Masson and put my face on the sand. I said \\nit was nice and he agreed. Soon afterwards Marie came \\nback. I rolled over to watch her coming. She was \\nglistening all over with salty water and holding her hair \\nback. She lay down right next to me and the combined \\nwarmth from her body and from the sun made me doze \\noff. \\nMarie shook me and told me that Masson had gone \\nback up to the house, that it was time for lunch. I got \\nup right away because I was hungry, but Marie told me \\nI hadn\\'t kissed her since that morning. It was true, \\nand yet I had wanted to. \"Come into the water,\" she said. \\nWe ran and threw ourselves into the first little waves. \\nWe swam a few strokes and she reached out and held \\non to me. I felt her legs wrapped around mine and I \\nwanted her. \\nWhen we got back, Masson was already calling us. \\nI said I was starving and then out of the blue he an\\xad\\nnounced to his wife that he liked me. The bread was \\ngood; I devoured my share of the fish. After that there \\n51 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 60}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nwas some meat and fried potatoes. We all ate without \\ntalking. Masson drank a lot of wine and kept filling my \\nglass. By the time the coffee carne, my head felt heavy \\nand I smoked a lot. Masson, Raymond, and I talked \\nabout spending August together at the beach, sharing \\nexpenses. Suddenly Marie said, \"Do you know what \\ntime it is? It\\'s only eleven-th irty!\" We were all sur\\xad\\nprised, but Masson said that we\\'d eaten very early and \\nthat it was only natural because lunchtime was when\\xad\\never you were hungry. For some reason that made Marie \\nlaugh. I think she\\'d had a little too much to drink. \\nThen Masson asked me if I wanted to go for a walk on \\nthe beach with him. \"My wife always takes a nap after \\nlunch. Me, I don\\'t like naps. I need to walk. I tell her all \\nthe time it\\'s better for her health. But it\\'s her business .\" \\nMarie said she\\'d stay and help Madame Masson with \\nthe dishes. The little Parisienne said that first they\\'d have \\nto get rid of the men. The three of us went down to the \\nbeach. \\nThe sun was shining almost directly overhead onto \\nthe sand, and the glare on the water was unbearable. \\nThere was no one left on the beach. From inside the \\nbungalows bordering the plateau and jutting out over \\nthe water, we could hear the rattling of plates and \\nsilverware. It was hard to breathe in the rocky heat \\nrising from the ground. At first Raymond and Masson \\ndiscussed people and things I didn\\'t know about. I \\ngathered they\\'d known each other for a long time and \\nhad even lived together at one point. We headed down ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 61}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nto the sea and walked along the water\\'s edge. Now and \\nthen a little wave would come up higher than the \\nothers and wet our canvas shoes. I wasn\\'t thinking \\nabout anything, because I was half asleep from the sun \\nbeating down on my bare head. \\nAt that point Raymond said something to Masson \\nwhich I didn\\'t quite catch. But at the same time I \\nnoticed, at the far end of the beach and a long way from \\nus, two Arabs in blue overalls coming in our direction. \\nI looked at Raymond and he said, \"It\\'s him.\" We kept \\nwalking. Masson asked how they\\'d managed to follow \\nus all this way. I thought they must have seen us get on \\nthe bus with a beach bag, but I didn\\'t say anything. \\nThe Arabs were walking slowly, but they were \\nalready much closer. We didn\\'t change our pace, but \\nRaymond said, \"If there\\'s any trouble, Masson, you \\ntake the other one. I\\'ll take care of my man. Meursault, \\nif another one shows up, he\\'s yours.\" I said, \"Yes,\" and \\nMasson put his hands in his pockets. The blazing sand \\nlooked red to me now. We moved steadily toward the \\nArabs. The distance between us was getting shorter and \\nshorter. When we were just a few steps away from each \\nother, the Arabs stopped. Masson and I slowed down. \\nRaymond went right up to his man. I couldn\\'t hear \\nwhat he said to him, but the other guy made a move as \\nthough he were going to butt him. Then Raymond struck \\nthe first blow and called Masson right away. Masson went \\nfor the one that had been pointed out as his and hit him \\ntwice, as hard as he could. The Arab fell Aat in the water, \\n53 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 62}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R o \\nfacedown, and lay there for several seconds with bubbles \\nbursting on the surface around his head. Meanwhile \\nRaymond had landed one too, and the other Arab\\'s face \\nwas bleeding. Raymond turned to me and said, \"Watch \\nthis. I\\'m gonna let him have it now.\" I shouted, \"Look \\nout, he\\'s got a knife!\" But Raymond\\'s arm had already \\nbeen cut open and his mouth slashed. Masson lunged \\nforward. But the other Arab had gotten back up and gone \\naround behind the one with the knife. We didn\\'t dare \\nmove. They started backing off slowly, without taking \\ntheir eyes off us, keeping us at bay with the knife. When \\nthey thought they were far enough away, they took off \\nrunning as fast as they could while we stood there \\nmotionless in the sun and Raymond clutched at his arm \\ndripping with blood. \\nMasson immediat ely said there was a doctor who \\nspent his Sundays up on the plateau. Raymond wanted \\nto go see him right away. But every time he tried to talk \\nthe blood bubbled in his mouth. We steadied him and \\nmade our way back to the bungalow as quickly as we \\ncould. Once there, Raymond said that they were only \\nflesh wounds and that he could make it to the doctor\\'s. \\nHe left with Masson and I stayed to explain to the \\nwomen what had happened. Madame Masson was cry\\xad\\ning and Marie was very pale. I didn\\'t like having to ex\\xad\\nplain to them, so I just shut up, smoked a cigarette, and \\nlooked at the sea. \\nRaymond came back with Masson around one-thirty. \\nHis arm was bandaged up and he had an adhesive \\n54 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 63}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nplaster on the comer of his mouth. The doctor had told \\nhim that it was nothing, but Raymond looked pretty \\ngrim. Masson tried to make him laugh. But he still \\nwouldn't say anything. When he said he was going \\ndown to the beach, I asked him where he was going. \\nHe said he wanted to get some air. Masson and I said \\nwe'd go with him. But that made him angry and he swore \\nat us. Masson said not to argue with him. I followed \\nhim anyway. \\nWe walked on the beach for a long time. By now \\nthe sun was overpoweri ng. It shattered into little pieces \\non the sand and water. I had the impression that Ray\\xad\\nmond knew where he was going, but I was probably \\nwrong. At the far end of the beach we finally came to a \\nlittle spring running down through the sand behind a \\nlarge rock. There we found our two Arabs. They were \\nlying down, in their greasy overalls. They seemed per\\xad\\nfectly calm and almost content. Our coming changed \\nnothing. The one who had attacked Raymond was \\nlooking at him without saying anything. The other one \\nwas blowing through a little reed over and over again, \\nwatching us out of the comer of his eye. He kept repeat\\xad\\ning the only three notes he could get out of his in\\xad\\nstrument. \\nThe whole time there was nothing but the sun and \\nthe silence, with the low gurgling from the spring and \\nthe three notes. Then Raymond put his hand in his \\nhip pocket, but the others didn't move, they just kept \\nlooking at each other. I noticed that the toes on the one \\n55 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 64}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGER o \\nplaying the flute were tensed. But without taking his \\neyes off his adversary, Raymond asked me, \"Should I \\nlet him have it?\" I thought that if I said no he\\'d get \\nhimself all worked up and shoot for sure. All I said was, \\n\"He hasn\\'t said anything yet. It\\'d be pretty lousy to \\nshoot him like that.\" You could still hear the sound of \\nthe water and the flute deep within the silence and the \\nheat. Then Raymond said, \"So I\\'ll call him something \\nand when he answers back, I\\'ll let him have it.\" I \\nanswered, \"Right. But if he doesn\\'t draw his knife, you \\ncan\\'t shoot.\" Raymond started getting worked up. The \\nother Arab went on playing, and both of them were \\nwatching every move Raymond made. \"No,\" I said \\nto Raymond, \"take him on man to man and give me your \\ngun. If the other one moves in, or if he draws his knife, \\nI\\'ll let him have it.\" \\nThe sun glinted off Raymond\\'s gun as he handed it \\nto me. But we just stood there motionless, as if every\\xad\\nthing had closed in around us. We stared at each other \\nwithout blinking, and everything carne to a stop there \\nbetween the sea, the sand, and the sun, and the double \\nsilence of the flute and the water. It was then that I \\nrealized that you could either shoot or not shoot. But \\nall of a sudden, the Arabs, backing away, slipped be\\xad\\nhind the rock. So Raymond and I turned and headed \\nback the way we\\'d come. He seemed better and talked \\nabout the bus back. \\nI went with him as far as the bungalow, and as he \\nclimbed the wooden steps, I just stood there at the \\ns6 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 65}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE ST RA NGE R o \\nbottom, my head ringing from the sun, unable to face \\nthe effort it would take to climb the wooden staircase \\nand face the women again. But the heat was so intense \\nthat it was just as bad standing still in the blinding \\nstream falling from the sky. To stay or to go, it amounted \\nto the same thing. A minute later I turned back toward \\nthe beach and started walking. \\nThere was the same dazzling red glare. The sea \\ngasped for air with each shallow, stifled little wave that \\nbroke on the sand. I was walking slowly toward the \\nrocks and I could feel my forehead swelling under the \\nsun. All that heat was pressing down on me and making \\nit hard for me to go on. And every time I felt a blast of \\nits hot breath strike my face, I gritted my teeth, clenched \\nmy fists in my trouser pockets, and strained every nerve \\nin order to overcome the sun and the thick drunkenness \\nit was spilling over me. With every blade of light that \\nHashed off the sand, from a bleached shell or a piece of \\nbroken glass, my jaws tightened. I walked for a long \\ntime. \\nFrom a distance I could see the small, dark mass of \\nrock surrounded by a blinding halo of light and sea \\nspray. I was thinking of the cool spring behind the rock. \\nI wanted to hear the murmur of its water again, to escape \\nthe sun and the strain and the women's tears, and to \\nfind shade and rest again at last. But as I got closer, I \\nsaw that Raymond's man had come back. \\nHe was alone. He was lying on his back, with his \\nhands behind his head, his forehead in the shade of the \\n57 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 66}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nrock, the rest of his body in the sun. His blue overalls \\nseemed to be steaming in the heat. I was a little sur\\xad\\nprised. As far as I was concerned, the whole thing was \\nover, and I'd gone there without even thinking about it. \\nAs soon as he saw me, he sat up a little and put his \\nhand in his pocket. Naturally, I gripped Raymond's \\ngun inside my jacket. Then he lay back again, but with\\xad\\nout taking his hand out of his pocket. I was pretty far \\naway from him, about ten meters or so. I could tell he was \\nglancing at me now and then through half-closed eyes. \\nBut most of the time, he was just a form shimmering \\nbefore my eyes in the fiery air. The sound of the waves \\nwas even lazier, more drawn out than at noon. It was \\nthe same sun, the same light still shining on the same \\nsand as before. For two hours the day had stood still; \\nfor two hours it had been anchored in a sea of molten \\nlead. On the horizon, a tiny steamer went by, and I \\nmade out the black dot from the corner of my eye be\\xad\\ncause I hadn't stopped watching the Arab. \\nIt occurred to me that all I had to do was turn \\naround and that would be the end of it. But the whole \\nbeach, throbbing in the sun, was pressing on my back. I \\ntook a few steps toward the spring. The Arab didn't \\nmove. Besides, he was still pretty far away. Maybe it \\nwas the shadows on his face, but it looked like he was \\nlaughing. I waited. The sun was starting to burn my \\ncheeks, and I could feel drops of sweat gathering in my \\neyebrows. The sun was the same as it had been the \\nday I'd buried Maman, and like then, my forehead \\nss \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 67}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE ST RANGE R o \\nespecially was hurting me, all the veins in it throbbing \\nunder the skin. It was this burning, which I couldn't \\nstand anymore, that made me move forward. I knew \\nthat it was stupid, that I wouldn't get the sun off me \\nby stepping forward. But I took a step, one step, forward. \\nAnd this time, without getting up, the Arab drew his \\nknife and held it up to me in the sun. The light shot off \\nthe steel and it was like a long Hashing blade cutting at \\nmy forehead. At the same instant the sweat in my eye\\xad\\nbrows dripped down over my eyelids all at once and \\ncovered them with a warm, thick film. My eyes were \\nblinded behind the curtain of tears and salt. All I could \\nfeel were the cymbals of sunlight crashing on my fore\\xad\\nhead and, indistinctly, the dazzling spear Hying up from \\nthe knife in front of me. The scorching blade slashed at \\nmy eyelashes and stabbed at my stinging eyes. That's \\nwhen everyth ing began to reel. The sea carried up a \\nthick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open \\nfrom one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole \\nbeing tensed and I squeezed my hand around the \\nrevolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside \\nof the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafen\\xad\\ning at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off \\nthe sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the \\nharmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach \\nwhere I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at \\nthe motionless body where the bullets lodged without \\nleaving a trace.

He had me \\nsit down and very politely informed me that, \"due to \\nunforeseen circumstances,\" my lawyer had been unable \\nto come. But I had the right to remain silent and to wait \\nfor my lawyer\\'s counsel . I said that I could answer for \\nmyself. He pressed a button on the table. A young clerk \\ncame in and sat down right behind me. \\nThe two of us leaned back in our chairs. The \\nexamination began. He started out by saying that peo\\xad\\nple were describing me as a taciturn and withdrawn \\nperson and he wanted to know what I thought. I an\\xad\\nswered, \"It\\'s just that I don\\'t have much to say. So I \\nkeep quiet.\" He smiled the way he had the first time, \\nagreed that that was the best reason of all, and added, \\n\"Besides, it\\'s not important.\" Then he looked at me \\nwithout saying anything, leaned forward rather abruptly, \\nand said very quickly, \"What interests me is you.\" I \\ndidn\\'t really understand what he meant by that, so I \\n66 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 75}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\ndidn\\'t respond. \"There are one or two things,\" he \\nadded, \"that I don\\'t quite understand. I\\'m sure you\\'ll \\nhelp me clear them up.\" I said it was all pretty simple. \\nHe pressed me to go back over that day. I went back \\nover what I had already told him: Raymond, the beach, \\nthe swim, the quarrel, then back to the beach, the little \\nspring, the sun, and the five shots from the revolver. \\nAfter each sentence he would say, \"Fine, fine.\" When I \\ngot to the body lying there, he nodded and said, \"Good.\" \\nBut I was tired of repeating the same story over and \\nover. It seemed as if I had never talked so much in my \\nlife. \\nAfter a short silence, he stood up and told me that he \\nwanted to help me, that I interested him, and that, with \\nGod\\'s help, he would do something for me. But first \\nhe wanted to ask me a few more questions. Without \\nworking up to it, he asked if I loved Maman. I said, \\n\"Yes, the same as anyone,\" and the clerk, who up to then \\nhad been typing steadily, must have hit the wrong key, \\nbecause he lost his place and had to go back. Again \\nwithout any apparent logic, the magistrate then asked if \\nI had fired all five shots at once. I thought for a minute \\nand explained that at first I had fired a single shot and \\nthen, a few seconds later, the other four. Then he said, \\n\"Why did you pause between the first and second shot?\" \\nOnce again I could see the red sand and feel the burning \\nof the sun on my forehead. But this time I didn\\'t answer. \\nIn the silence that followed, the magistrate seemed to be \\ngetting fidgety. He sat down, ran his fingers through his ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 76}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGE R 0 \\nhair, put his elbows on his desk, and leaned toward me \\nslightly with a strange look on his face. \"Why, why did \\nyou shoot at a body that was on the ground?\" Once again \\nI didn\\'t know how to answer. The magistrate ran his \\nhands across his forehead and repeated his question with \\na slightly different tone in his voice. \"Why? You must \\ntell me. Why?\" Still I didn\\'t say anything. \\nSuddenly he stood up, strode over to a far corner \\nof his office, and pulled out a drawer in a file cabinet. \\nHe took out a silver crucifix which he brandished as he \\ncame toward me. And in a completely different, almost \\ncracked voice, he shouted, \"Do you know what this is?\" \\nI said, \"Yes, of course.\" Speaking very quickly and pas\\xad\\nsionately, he told me that he believed in God, that it \\nwas his conviction that no man was so guilty that God \\nwould not forgive him, but in order for that to happen \\na man must repent and in so doing become like a child \\nwhose heart is open and ready to embrace all. He was \\nleaning all the way over the table. He was waving his \\ncrucifix almost directly over my head. To tell the truth, \\nI had found it very hard to follow his reasoning, first \\nbecause I was hot and there were big Hies in his office \\nthat kept landing on my face, and also because he was \\nscaring me a little. At the same time I knew that that \\nwas ridiculous because, after all, I was the criminal. He \\nwent on anyway. I vaguely understood that to his mind \\nthere was just one thing that wasn\\'t clear in my con\\xad\\nfession, the fact that I had hesitated before I fired my \\nsecond shot. The rest was fine, but that part he couldn\\'t \\nunderst and. \\n68 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 77}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGE R o \\nI was about to tell him he was wrong to dwell on it, \\nbecause it really didn\\'t matter. But he cut me off and \\nurged me one last time, drawing himself up to his full \\nheight and asking me if I believed in God. I said no. He \\nsat down indignantly. He said it was impossib le; all men \\nbelieved in God, even those who turn their backs on him. \\nThat was his belief, and if he were ever to doubt it, his \\nlife would become meaningless. \"Do you want my life to \\nbe meanin gless?\" he shouted. As far as I could see, it \\ndidn\\'t have anything to do with me, and I told him so. \\nBut from across the table he had already thrust the \\ncrucifix in my face and was screaming irrationally, \"I \\nam a Christian. I ask Him to forgive you your sins. How \\ncan you not believe that He suffered for you?\" I was \\nstruck by how sincere he seemed, but I had had enough. \\nIt was getting hotter and hotter. As always, whenever I \\nwant to get rid of someone I\\'m not really listening to, \\nI made it appear as if I agreed. To my surprise, he acted \\ntriumphant. \"You see, you see!\" he said. \"You do believe, \\ndon\\'t you, and you\\'re going to place your trust in Him, \\naren\\'t you?\" Obviously, I again said no. He fell back \\nin his chair. \\nHe seemed to be very tired. He didn\\'t say anything \\nfor a minute while the typewriter, which hadn\\'t let up \\nthe whole time, was still tapping out the last few sen\\xad\\ntences. Then he looked at me closely and with a little \\nsadness in his face. In a low voice he said, \"I have never \\nseen a soul as hardened as yours. The criminals who have \\ncome before me have always wept at the sight of this \\nimage of suffering.\" I was about to say that that was \\n69 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='o THE ST RA NGE R o \\nprecisely because they were criminals. But then I \\nrealized that I was one too. It was an idea I couldn\\'t get \\nused to. Then the judge stood up, as if to give me the \\nsignal that the examination was over. He simply asked, \\nin the same weary tone, if I was sorry for what I had \\ndone. I thought about it for a minute and said that \\nmore than sorry I felt kind of annoyed. I got the im\\xad\\npression he didn\\'t understand. But that was as far as \\nthings went that day. \\nAfter that, I saw a lot of the magistrate, except that \\nmy lawyer was with me each time. But it was just a \\nmatter of clarifying certain things in my previous state\\xad\\nments. Or else the magistrate would discuss the charges \\nwith my lawyer. But on those occasions they never really \\npaid much attention to me. Anyway, the tone of the ques\\xad\\ntioning gradually changed. The magistrate seemed to \\nhave lost interest in me and to have come to some sort \\nof decision about my case. He didn\\'t talk to me about \\nGod anymore, and I never saw him as worked up as he \\nwas that first day. The result was that our discussions \\nbecame more cordial. A few questions, a brief conversa\\xad\\ntion with my lawyer, and the examinations were over. \\nAs the magistrate put it, my case was taking its course. \\nAnd then sometimes, when the conversation was of a \\nmore general nature, I would be included . I started to \\nbreathe more freely. No one, in any of these meetings, \\nwas rough with me.

A \\nfew days after I entered prison, I realized that I wouldn't \\nlike talking about this part of my life. \\nLater on, though, I no longer saw any point to my \\nreluctance. In fact, I wasn't really in prison those first \\nfew days: I was sort of waiting for something to happen. \\nIt was only after Marie's first and last visit that it all \\nstarted. From the day I got her letter (she told me she \\nwould no longer be allowed to come, because she wasn't \\nmy wife), from that day on I felt that I was at home in \\nmy cell and that my life was coming to a standstill \\nthere. The day of my arrest I was first put in a room \\nwhere there were already several other prisoners, most of \\nthem Arabs. They laughed when they saw me. Then they \\nasked me what I was in for. I said I'd killed an Arab \\nand they were all silent. A few minutes later, it got dark. \\nThey showed me how to fix the mat I was supposed to \\nsleep on.

The prison was on \\nthe heights above the town, and through a small window \\nI could see the sea. One day as I was gripping the bars, \\nmy face straining toward the light, a guard came in and \\ntold me I had a visitor. I thought it must be Marie. It \\nwas. \\nTo get to the visiting room I went down a long cor\\xad\\nridor, then down some stairs and, finally, another cor\\xad\\nridor. I walked into a very large room brightened by a \\nhuge bay window. The room was divided. into three \\nsections by two large grates that ran the length of the \\nroom. Between the two grates was a space of eight to \\nten meters which separated the visitors from the prisoners. \\nI spotted Marie standing at the opposite end of the room \\nwith her striped dress and her sun-tanned face. On my \\nside of the room there were about ten prisoners, most \\nof them Arabs. Marie was surrounded by Moorish women \\nand found herself between two visitors: a little, thin\\xad\\nlipped old woman dressed in black and a fat, bareheaded \\nwoman who was talking at the top of her voice and \\nmaking lots of gestures. Because of the distance between \\nthe grates, the visitors and the prisoners were forced to \\nspeak very loud. When I walked in, the sound of the \\nvoices echoing off the room's high, bare walls and the \\nharsh light pouring out of the sky onto the windows and \\nspilling into the room brought on a kind of dizziness. \\nMy cell was quieter and darker. It took me a few seconds \\nto adjust. But eventually I could see each face clearly, \\ndistinctly in the bright light. I noticed there was a \\n73 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 82}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nguard sitting at the far end of the passag e between the \\ntwo grates. Most of the Arab prisoners and their families \\nhad squatted down facing each other. They weren\\'t \\nshouting. Despite the commotion, they were managing to \\nmake themselves heard by talking in very low voices. \\nTheir subdued murmuring, coming from lower down, \\nformed a kind of bass accompaniment to the conversa\\xad\\ntions crossing above their heads. I took all this in very \\nquickly as I made my way toward Marie. Already pressed \\nup against the grate, she was smiling her best smile for \\nme. I thought she looked very beautiful, but I didn\\'t \\nknow how to tell her. \\n\"Well?\" she called across to me. \"Well, here I am.\" \\n\"Are you all right? Do you have everything you want?\" \\n\"Yes, everything.\" \\nWe stopped talking and Marie went on smiling. The \\nfat woman yelled to the man next to me, her husband \\nprobably, a tall blond guy with an honest face. It was the \\ncontinua tion of a conversation already under way. \\n\"Jeanne wouldn\\'t take him,\" she shouted as loudly as \\nshe could. \"Uh-huh,\" said the man. \"I told her you\\'d \\ntake him back when you get out, but she wouldn\\'t take \\nhim.\" \\nThen it was Marie\\'s turn to shout, that Raymond \\nsent his regards, and I said, \"Thanks.\" But my voice was \\ndrowned out by the man next to me, who asked, \"Is he \\nall right?\" His wife laughed and said, \"He\\'s never been \\nbetter.\" The man on my left, a small young man with \\ndelicate hands, wasn\\'t saying anything. I noticed that \\n74 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 83}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nhe was across from the little old lady and that they were \\nstaring intently at each other. But I didn\\'t have time to \\nwatch them any longer, because Marie shouted to me \\nthat I had to have hope. I said, \"Yes.\" I was looking at \\nher as she said it and I wanted to squeeze her shoulders \\nthrough her dress. I wanted to feel the thin material and \\nI didn\\'t really know what else I had to hope for other \\nthan that. But that was probably what Marie meant, \\nbecause she was still smiling. All I could see was the \\nsparkle of her teeth and the little folds of her eyes. She \\nshouted again, \"You\\'ll get out and we\\'ll get married !\" I \\nanswered, \"You think so?\" but it was mainly just to say \\nsomething. Then very quickly and still in a very loud \\nvoice she said yes, that I would be acquitted and that we \\nwould go swimming again. But the other woman took \\nher turn to shout and said that she had left a basket at \\nthe clerk\\'s office. She was listing all the things she had \\nput in it, to make sure they were all there, because they \\ncost a lot of money. The young man and his mother \\nwere still staring at each other. The murmuring of the \\nArabs continued below us. Outside, the light seemed to \\nsurge up over the bay window. \\nI was feeling a little sick and I\\'d have liked to leave. \\nThe noise was getting painful. But on the other hand, I \\nwanted to make the most of Marie\\'s being there. I don\\'t \\nknow how much time went by. Marie told me about her \\njob and she never stopped smiling. The murmuring, the \\nshouting, and the conversations were crossing back and \\nforth. The only oasis of silence was next to me where \\n75 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 84}), Document(page_content='0 THE STR ANGER 0 \\nthe small young man and the old woman were gazing at \\neach other. One by one the Arabs were taken away. \\nAlmost everyone stopped talking as soon as the first one \\nleft. The little old woman moved closer to the bars, \\nand at the same moment a guard motioned to her son. \\nHe said \"Goodbye, Maman,\" and she reached between \\ntwo bars to give him a long, slow little wave. \\nShe left just as another man came in, hat in hand, \\nand took her place. Another prisoner was brought in and \\nthey talked excitedly, but softly, because the room had \\nonce again grown quiet. They came for the man on my \\nright, and his wife said to him without lowering her \\nvoice, as if she hadn\\'t noticed there was no need to \\nshout anymore, \"Take care of yourself and be careful.\" \\nThen it was my turn. Marie threw me a kiss. I looked \\nback before disappearing. She hadn\\'t moved and her face \\nwas still pressed against the bars with the same sad, forced \\nsmile on it. \\nShortly after that was when she wrote to me. And \\nthe things I\\'ve never liked talking about began. Anyway, \\nI shouldn\\'t exaggera te, and it was easier for me than \\nfor others. When I was first imprisoned, the hardest \\nthing was that my thoughts were still those of a free man. \\nFor example, I would suddenly have the urge to be on a \\nbeach and to walk down to the water. As I imagined the \\nsound of the first waves under my feet, my body enter\\xad\\ning the water and the sense of relief it would give me, \\nall of a sudden I would feel just how closed in I was by \\nthe walls of my cell. But that only lasted a few months.

The rest of the time I \\nmanaged pretty well. At the time, I often thought that \\nif I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with \\nnothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, \\nlittle by little I would have gotten used to it. I would \\nhave waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle, \\njust as here I waited to see my lawyer's ties and just as, \\nin another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday \\nto hold Marie's body in my arms. Now, as I think back \\non it, I wasn't in a hollow tree trunk. There were others \\nworse off than me. Anyway, it was one of Maman's ideas, \\nand she often repeated it, that after a while you could \\nget used to anything. \\nBesides, I usually didn't take things so far. The first \\nmonths were hard. But in fact the effort I had to make \\nhelped pass the time. For example, I was tormented by \\nmy desire for a woman. It was only natural; I was young. \\nI never thought specifically of Marie. But I thought so \\nmuch about a woman, about women , about all the ones \\nI had known, about all the circumstances in which I had \\nenjoyed them, that my cell would be filled with their \\nfaces and crowded with my desires. In one sense, it \\nthrew me off balance. But in another, it killed time. I \\nhad ended up making friends with the head guard, who \\nused to make the rounds with the kitchen hands at meal\\xad\\ntime. He's the one who first talked to me about women. \\nHe told me it was the first thing the others complained \\n77 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 86}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nabout. I told him it was the same for me and that I \\nthought it was unfair treatment. \"But,\" he said, \"that\\'s \\nexactly why you\\'re in prison.\" \"What do you mean that\\'s \\nwhy?\" \"Well, yes-freedom, that\\'s why. They\\'ve taken \\naway your freedom .\" I\\'d never thought about that. I \\nagreed. \"It\\'s true,\" I said. \"Otherwise, what would be \\nthe punishment?\" \"Right. You see, you understand \\nthese things. The rest of them don\\'t. But they just end \\nup doing it by themselv es.\" The guar d left after that. \\nThere were the cigarettes, too. When I entered \\nprison, they took away my belt, my shoelaces, my tie, and \\neverything I had in my pockets, my cigarettes in par\\xad\\nticular. Once I was in my cell, I asked to have them back. \\nBut I was told I wasn\\'t allowed. The first few days were \\nreally rough. That may be the thing that was hardest \\nfor me. I would suck on chips of wood that I broke off \\nmy bed planks. I walked around nauseated all day long. \\nI couldn\\'t understand why they had taken them away \\nwhen they didn\\'t hurt anybody. Later on I realized that \\nthat too was part of the punishment. But by then I had \\ngotten used to not smoking and it wasn\\'t a punishment \\nanymore. \\nApart from these annoyances, I wasn\\'t too unhappy. \\nOnce again the main problem was killing time.

But ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 87}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nevery time I started over, it took a little longer. I would \\nremember every piece of furniture; and on every piece of \\nfurniture, every object; and of every object, all the de\\xad\\ntails; and of the details themselves -a flake, a crack, or \\na chipped edge-the color and the texture. At the same \\ntime I would try not to lose the thread of my inventory, \\nto make a complete list, so that after a few weeks I \\ncould spend hours just enumerating the things that \\nwere in my room. And the more I thought about it, the \\nmore I dug out of my memory things I had overlooked \\nor forgotten. I realized then that a man who had lived \\nonly one day could easily live for a hundred years in \\nprison. He would have enough memories to keep him \\nfrom being bored. In a way, it was an advantage. \\nThen there was sleep. At first, I didn't sleep well at \\nnight and not at all during the day. Little by little, my \\nnights got better and I was able to sleep during the day, \\ntoo. In fact, during the last few months I've been sleep\\xad\\ning sixteen to eighteen hours a day. That would leave \\nme six hours to kill with meals, nature's call, my \\nmemories, and the story about the Czechoslov akian. \\nBetween my straw mattress and the bed planks, I \\nhad actually found an old scrap of newspaper, yellow \\nand transpar ent, half-stuck to the canvas. On it was a \\nnews story, the first part of which was missing, but \\nwhich must have taken place in Czechoslov akia. A \\nman had left a Czech village to seek his fortune. Twenty\\xad\\nfive years later, and now rich, he had returned with a \\nwife and a child. His mother was running a hotel with \\n79 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 88}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RA NGE R 0 \\nhis sister in the village where he\\'d been born. In order \\nto surprise them, he had left his wife and child at another \\nhotel and gone to see his mother, who didn\\'t recognize \\nhim when he walked in. As a joke he\\'d had the idea of \\ntaking a room. He had shown off his money. During the \\nnight his mother and his sister had beaten him to death \\nwith a hammer in order to rob him and had thrown his \\nbody in the river. The next morning the wife had come \\nto the hotel and, without knowing it, gave away the \\ntraveler\\'s identity. The mother hanged herself. The \\nsister threw herself down a well. I must have read that \\nstory a thousand times. On the one hand it wasn\\'t very \\nlikely. On the other, it was perfectly natural. Anyway, \\nI thought the traveler pretty much deserved what he \\ngot and that you should never play games. \\nSo, with all the sleep, my memories, reading my \\ncrime story, and the alternation of light and darkness, \\ntime passed. Of course I had read that eventually you \\nwind up losing track of time in prison. But it hadn\\'t \\nmeant much to me when I\\'d read it.

He told me that he hoped \\neverything would go well for me. I thanked him and \\nhe added, \"You know, we\\'ve blown your case up a little. \\nSummer is the slow season for the news. And your story \\nand the parricide were the only ones worth bothering \\nabout.\" Then he pointed in the direction of the group \\nhe had just left, at a little man who looked like a \\nfattened-up weasel. He told me that the man was a \\nspecial correspondent for a Paris paper. \"Actually, he \\ndidn\\'t come because of you. But since they assigned him \\nto cover the parricide trial, they asked him to send a dis\\xad\\npatch about your case at the same time.\" And again I \\nalmost thanked him. But I thought that that would be \\nridiculous. He waved cordially, shyly, and left us. We \\nwaited a few more minutes. \\nMy lawyer arrived, in his gown, surrounded by lots \\nof colleagues. He walked over to the reporters and shook ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 93}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nsome hands. They joked and laughed and looked com\\xad\\npletely at ease, until the moment when the bell in the \\ncourt rang. Everyone went back to his place. My lawyer \\nwalked over to me, shook my hand, and advised me to \\nrespond brieRy to the questions that would be put to me, \\nnot to volunteer anything, and to leave the rest to him. \\nTo my left I heard the sound of a chair being pulled \\nout and I saw a tall, thin man dressed in red and wear\\xad\\ning a pince-nez who was carefully folding his robe as he \\nsat down. That was the prosecutor. A bailiff said, \"All \\nrise.\" At the same time two large fans started to whir. \\nThree judges, two in black, the third in red, entered with \\nfiles in hand and walked briskly to the rostrum which \\ndominated the room. The man in the red gown sat on \\nthe chair in the middle, set his cap down in front of him, \\nwiped his bald little head with a handkerchief, and an\\xad\\nnounced that the court was now in session. \\nThe reporters already had their pens in hand. They \\nall had the same indifferent and somewhat snide look on \\ntheir faces. One of them, however, much younger than \\nthe others, wearing gray flannels and a blue tie, had left \\nhis pen lying in front of him and was looking at me. All \\nI could see in his slightly lopsided face were his two \\nvery bright eyes, which were examining me closely \\nwithout betraying any definable emotion. And I had the \\nodd impression of being watched by myself. Maybe it \\nwas for that reason, and also because I wasn\\'t familiar \\nwith all the procedures, that I didn\\'t quite understand \\neverything that happened next: the drawing of lots for \\nBs ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 94}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE STR ANGER 0 \\nthe jury; the questions put by the presiding judge to my \\nlawyer, the prosecutor, and the jury (each time, the \\njurors' heads would all turn toward the bench at the \\nsame time); the quick reading of the indictment, in \\nwhich I recognized names of people and places; and \\nsome more questions to my lawyer. \\nAnyway, the presiding judge said he was going to \\nproceed with the calling of witnesses. The bailiff read off \\nsome names that caught my attention. In the middle of \\nwhat until then had been a shapeless mass of spectators, \\nI saw them stand up one by one, only to disappear \\nagain through a side door: the director and the caretaker \\nfrom the home, old Thomas Perez, Raymond, Masson, \\nSalamano, and Marie. She waved to me, anxiously. I \\nwas still feeling surprised that I hadn't seen them before \\nwhen Celeste, the last to be called, stood up. I recog\\xad\\nnized next to him the little woman from the restaurant, \\nwith her jacket and her stiff and determined manner. \\nShe was staring right at me. But I didn't have time to \\nthink about them, because the presiding judge started \\nspeaking. He said that the formal proceedings were \\nabout to begin and that he didn't think he needed to \\nremind the public to remain silent. According to him, \\nhe was there to conduct in an impartial manner the pro\\xad\\nceedings of a case which he would consider objectively. \\nThe verdict returned by the jury would be taken in a \\nspirit of justice, and, in any event, he would have the \\ncourtroom cleared at the slightest disturbance. \\nIt was getting hotter, and I could see the people in \\n86 \", metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 95}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nthe courtroom fanning themselves with newspapers, \\nwhich made a continuous low rustling sound. The \\npresiding judge gave a signal and the bailiff brought \\nover three fans made of woven straw which the three \\njudges started waving immediately. \\nMy examination began right away. The presiding \\njudge questioned me calmly and even, it seemed to me, \\nwith a hint of cordiality. Once again he had me state \\nmy name, age, date and place of birth, and although it \\nirritated me, I realized it was only natural, because it \\nwould be a very serious thing to try the wrong man. Then \\nhe reread the narrative of what I\\'d done, turning to me \\nevery few sentences to ask \"Is that correct?\" Each time \\nI answered \"Yes, Your Honor,\" as my lawyer had in\\xad\\nstructed me to do. It took a long time because the \\njudge went into minute detail in his narrative. The \\nreporters were writing the whole time. I was conscious \\nof being watched by the youngest of them and by \\nthe little robot woman. Everyone on the row of streetcar \\nseats was turned directly toward the judge, who coughed, \\nleafed through his file, and turned toward me, fanning \\nhimself. \\nHe told me that he now had to turn to some ques\\xad\\ntions that might seem irrelevant to my case but might in \\nfact have a significant bearing on it. I knew right away \\nhe was going to talk about Maman again, and at the \\nsame time I could feel how much it irritated me. He \\nasked me wh) I had put Maman in the home. I answered \\nthat it was because I didn\\'t have the money to have her ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 96}), Document(page_content='o THE STRA NGER 0 \\nlooked after and cared for. He asked me if it had been \\nhard on me, and I answered that Marnan and I didn\\'t \\nexpect anything from each other anymore, or from any\\xad\\none else either, and that we had both gotten used to our \\nnew lives. The judge then said that he didn\\'t want to \\ndwell on this point, and he asked the prosecutor if he had \\nany further questions. \\nThe prosecutor had his back half-turned to me, and \\nwithout looking at me he stated that, with the court\\'s \\npermission, he would like to know whether I had gone \\nback to the spring by myself intending to kill the Arab. \\n\"No,\" I said. Well, then, why was I armed and why \\ndid I return to precisely that spot? I said it just happened \\nthat way. And the prosecutor noted in a nasty voice, \\n\"That will be all for now.\" After that things got a little \\nconfused, at least for me. But after some conferring, the \\njudge announced that the hearing was adjourned until \\nthe afternoon, at which time the witnesses would be \\nheard. \\nI didn\\'t even have time to think. I was taken out, \\nput into the van, and driven to the prison, where I had \\nsomething to eat. After a very short time, just long \\nenough for me to realize I was tired, they carne back \\nfor me; the whole thing started again, and I found \\nmyself in the same courtroom, in front of the same \\nfaces. Only it was much hotter, and as if by some \\nmiracle each member of the jury, the prosecutor, my \\nlawyer, and some of the reporters, too, had been pro\\xad\\nvided with straw fans. The young reporter and the little \\n88 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 97}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGER 0 \\nrobot woman were still there. They weren\\'t fanning \\nthemselves, but they were still watching me without \\nsaying a word. \\nI wiped away the sweat covering my face, and I had \\nbarely become aware of where I was and what I was \\ndoing when I heard the director of the home being \\ncalled. He was asked whether Marnan ever complained \\nabout me, and he said yes but that some of it was just a \\nway the residents all had of complaining about their \\nrelatives. The judge had him clarif y whether she used \\nto reproach me for having put her in the horne, and the \\ndirector again said yes. But this time he didn\\'t add any\\xad\\nthing else. To another question he replied that he had \\nbeen surprised by my calm the day of the funeral. He \\nwas asked what he meant by \"calm.\" The director then \\nlooked down at the tips of his shoes and said that I \\nhadn\\'t wanted to see Marnan, that I hadn\\'t cried once, \\nand that I had left right after the funeral without pa·y\\xad\\ning my last respects at her grave. And one other thing \\nhad surprised him: one of the men who worked for the \\nundertaker had told him I didn\\'t know how old Marnan \\nwas. There was a brief silence, and then the judge \\nasked him if he was sure I was the man he had just been \\nspeaking of. The director didn\\'t understand the question, \\nso the judge told him, \"It\\'s a formality.\" He then asked \\nthe prosecutor if he had any questions to put to the \\nwitness, and the prosecutor exclaimed, \"Oh no, that is \\nquite sufficient!\" with such glee and with such a tri\\xad\\numphant look in my direction that for the first time in ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 98}), Document(page_content='o THE STRANGER 0 \\nyears I had this stupid urge to cry, because I could feel \\nhow much all these people hated me. \\nAfter asking the jury and my lawyer if they had any \\nquestions, the judge called the caretaker. The same \\nritual was repeated for him as for all the others. As he \\ntook the stand the caretaker glanced at me and then \\nlooked away. He answered the questions put to him. He \\nsaid I hadn\\'t wanted to see Maman, that I had smoked \\nand slept some, and that I had had some coffee. It was \\nthen I felt a stirring go through the room and for the \\nfirst time I realized that I was guilty. The caretaker was \\nasked to repeat the part about the coffee and the cigarette. \\nThe prosecutor looked at me with an ironic gleam in his \\neye. At that point my lawyer asked the caretaker if it \\nwasn\\'t true that he had smoked a cigarette with me. But \\nthe prosecutor objected vehemently to this question . \\n\"Who is on trial here and what kind of tactics are these, \\ntrying to taint the witnesses for the prosecution in an \\neffort to detract from testimony that remains nonethe\\xad\\nless overwhel ming!\" In spite of all that, the judge directed \\nthe caretaker to answer the question . The old man \\nlooked embarrassed and said, \"I know I was wrong to do \\nit. But I couldn\\'t refuse the cigarette when monsieur \\noffered it to me.\" Lastly, I was asked if I had anything to \\nadd. \"Nothing,\" I said, \"except that the witness is right. \\nIt\\'s true, I did offer him a cigarette .\" The caretaker gave \\nme a surprised and somehow grateful look. He hesitated \\nand then he said that he was the one who offered me \\nthe coffee. My lawyer was exultant and stated loudly that ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 99}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nthe jury would take note of the fact. But the prosecutor \\nshouted over our heads and said, \"Indeed, the gentlemen \\nof the jury will take note of the fact. And they will \\nconclude that a stranger may offer a cup of coffee, but \\nthat beside the body of the one who brought him into the \\nworld, a son should have refused it.\" The caretaker went \\nback to his bench. \\nWhen Thomas Perez\\'s turn came, a bailiff had to \\nhold him up and help him get to the witness stand. \\nPerez said it was really my mother he had known and \\nthat he had seen me only once, on the day of the funeral. \\nHe was asked how I had acted that day and he replied, \\n\"You understand, I was too sad. So I didn\\'t see anything. \\nMy sadness made it impossible to see anything. Be\\xad\\ncause for me it was a very great sadness. And I even \\nfainted. So I wasn\\'t able to see monsieur.\" The prosecu\\xad\\ntor asked him if he had at least seen me cry. Perez \\nanswered no. The prosecutor in turn said, \"The gentle\\xad\\nmen of the jury will take note.\" But my lawyer got \\nangry. He asked Perez in what seemed to be an exag\\xad\\ngerated tone of voice if he had seen me not cry. Perez \\nsaid, \"No.\" The spectators laughed. And my lawyer, \\nrolling up one of his sleeves, said with finality, \"Here \\nwe have a perfect reflection of this entire trial: everything \\nis true and nothing is true!\" The prosecutor had a blank \\nexpression on his face, and with a pencil he was poking \\nholes in the title page of his case file. \\nAfter a five-minute recess, during which my lawyer \\ntold me that everything was working out for the best, we \\n91 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 100}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nheard the testimony of Celeste, who was called by the \\ndefense. \"The defense\" meant me. Every now and then \\nCeleste would glance over in my direction and rotate \\nhis panama hat in his hands. He was wearing the new \\nsuit he used to put on to go with me to the races some\\xad\\ntimes on Sundays. But I think he must not have been \\nable to get his collar on, because he only had a brass \\nstud keeping his shirt fastened. He was asked if I was \\na customer of his and he said, \"Yes, but he was also a \\nfriend\"; what he thought of me, and he answered that I \\nwas a man; what he meant by that, and he stated that \\neverybody knew what that meant; if he had noticed that \\nI was ever withdrawn, and all he would admit was that \\nI didn\\'t speak unless I had something to say. The prosecu\\xad\\ntor asked him if I kept up with my bill. Celeste laughed \\nand said, \"Between us those were just details.\" He was \\nagain asked what he thought about my crime. He put his \\nhands on the edge of the box, and you could tell he had \\nsomething prepared. He said, \"The way I see it, it\\'s bad \\nluck. Everybody knows what bad luck is. It leaves you \\ndefenseless. And there it is! The way I see it, it\\'s bad \\nluck.\" He was about to go on, but the judge told him \\nthat that would be all and thanked him. Celeste was a \\nlittle taken aback. But he stated that he had more to say. \\nHe was asked to be brief. He again repeated that it was \\nbad luck. And the judge said, \"Yes, fine. But we are here \\nto judge just this sort of bad luck. Thank you.\" And \\nas if he had reached the end of both his knowledge and \\nhis goodwill, Celeste then turned toward me. It looked \\n92 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 101}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nto me as if his eyes were glistening and his lips were \\ntrembling. He seemed to be asking me what else he \\ncould do. I said nothing; I made no gesture of any kind, \\nbut it was the first time in my life I ever wanted to kiss \\na man. The judge again instructed him to step down. \\nCeleste went and sat among the spectators. He sat there \\nthroughout the entire trial, leaning forward, his elbows on \\nhis knees, the panama hat in his hands, listening to \\neverything that was said. \\nMarie entered. She had put on a hat and she was still \\nbeautiful. But I liked her better with her hair loose. \\nFrom where I was sitting, I could just make out the \\nslight fullness of her breasts, and I recognized the little \\npout of her lower lip. She seemed very nervous. Right \\naway she was asked how long she had known me. She \\nsaid since the time she worked in our office. The judge \\nwanted to know what her relation to me was. She said \\nshe was my friend. To another question she answered \\nyes, it was true that she was supposed to marry me. Flip\\xad\\nping through a file, the prosecutor asked her bluntly \\nwhen our \"liaison\" had beg un. She indicated the date. \\nThe prosecutor remarked indifferently that if he was \\nnot mistaken, that was the day after Maman died. Then \\nin a slightly ironic tone he said that he didn\\'t mean to \\ndwell on such a delicate matter, and that he fully ap\\xad\\npreciated Marie\\'s misgivings, but (and here his tone \\ngrew firmer) that he was duty bound to go beyond \\npropriety. So he asked Marie to describe briefly that day \\nwhen I had first known her. Marie didn\\'t want to, but \\n93 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 102}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRA NGER 0 \\nat the prosecutor\\'s insistence, she went over our swim, \\nthe movies, and going back to my place. The prosecutor \\nsaid that after Marie had given her statements to the \\nexamining magistrate, he had consulted the movie list\\xad\\nings for that day. He added that Marie herself would tell \\nthe court what film was showing. In an almost expression\\xad\\nless voice she did in fact tell the court that it was a \\nFernandel film. By the time she had finished there was \\ncomplete silence in the courtroom. The prosecutor then \\nrose and, very gravely and with what struck me as real \\nemotion in his voice, his finger pointing at me, said \\nslowly and distinctly, \"Gentlemen of the jury, the day \\nafter his mother\\'s death, this man was out swimming, \\nstarting up a dubious liaison, and going to the movies, a \\ncomedy, for laughs. I have nothing further to say.\" He \\nsat down in the still-silent courtroom. But all of a \\nsudden Marie began to sob, saying it wasn\\'t like that, \\nthere was more to it, and that she was being made to say \\nthe opposite of what she was thinking, that she knew me \\nand I hadn\\'t done anything wrong. But at a signal from \\nthe judge, the bailiff ushered her out and the trial pro\\xad\\nceeded. \\nHardly anyone listened after that when Masson testi\\xad\\nfied that I was an honest man \"and I\\'d even say a \\ndecent one.\" Hardly anyone listened to Salamano either, \\nwhen he recalled how I had been good to his dog and \\nwhen he answered a question about my mother and me \\nby saying that I had run out of things to say to Maman \\nand that was why I\\'d put her in the home. \"You must \\n94 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 103}), Document(page_content='0 THE STR AN\\':>ER 0 \\nunderstand,\" Salamano kept saying, \"you must under\\xad\\nstand.\" But no one seemed to understa nd. He was \\nushered out. \\nNext came Raymond, who was the last witness. He \\nwaved to me and all of a sudden, he blurted out that I was \\ninnocent. But the judge advised him that he was being \\nasked not for judgments but for facts. He was instructed \\nto wait for the questions before responding. He was \\ndirected to state precisely what his relations with the \\nvictim were. Raymond took this opportunity to say that \\nhe was the one the victim hated ever since he had hit \\nthe guy\\'s sister. Nevertheless, the judge asked him \\nwhether the victim hadn\\'t also had reason to hate me. \\nRaymond said that my being at the beach was just \\nchance. The prosecutor then asked him how it was that \\nthe letter that set the whole drama in motion had been \\nwritten by me. Raymond responded that it was just \\nchance. The prosecutor retorted that chance already had \\na lot of misdeeds on its conscience in this case. He \\nwanted to know if it was just by chance that I hadn\\'t \\nintervened when Raymond had beaten up his girlfriend, \\njust by chance that I had acted as a witness at the police \\nstation, and again just by chance that my statements on \\nthat occasion had proved to be so convenient. Finishing \\nup, he asked Raymond how he made his living, and \\nwhen Raymond replied \"warehouse guard,\" the prosecu\\xad\\ntor informed the jury that it was common knowledge that \\nthe witness practiced the profession of procurer. I was \\nhis friend and accomplice. They had before them the \\n95 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 104}), Document(page_content='0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nbasest of crimes, a crime made worse than sordid by the \\nfact that they were dealing with a monster, a man with\\xad\\nout morals. Raymond wanted to defend himself and my \\nlawyer objected, but they were instructed that they must \\nlet the prosecutor finish. \"I have little to add,\" the prose\\xad\\ncutor said. \"Was he your friend?\" he asked Raymond. \\n\"Y \" R d \"d \"W I \" Th es, aymon sa1 . e were pas. e prosecutor \\nthen put the same question to me, and I looked at Ray\\xad\\nmond, who returned my gaze. I answered, \"Yes.\" The \\nprosecutor then turned to the jury and declared, \"The \\nsame man who the day after his mother died was in\\xad\\ndulging in the most shameful debauchery killed a man \\nfor the most trivial of reasons and did so in order to \\nsettle an affair of unspeakable vice.\" \\nHe then sat down. But my lawyer had lost his \\npatience, and, raising his hands so high that his sleeves \\nfell, revealing the creases of a starched shirt, he shouted, \\n\"Come now, is my client on trial for burying his mother \\nor for killing a man?\" The spectators laughed. But the \\nprosecutor rose to his feet again, adjusted his robe, and \\ndeclared that only someone with the naivete of his \\nesteemed colleague could fail to appreciate that between \\nthese two sets of facts there existed a profound, funda\\xad\\nmental, and tragic relationsh ip. \"Indeed,\" he loudly \\nexclaimed, \"I accuse this man of burying his mother \\nWith crime in his heart!\" This pronouncement seemed \\nto have a strong effect on the people in the courtroom. \\nMy lawyer shrugged his shoulders and wiped the sweat \\nfrom his brow.

Only bits and pieces-a \\ngesture or a long but isolated tirade-caugh t my atten\\xad\\ntion or aroused my interest. \\nThe gist of what he was saying, if I understood him \\ncorrectly, was that my crime was premeditated. At least \\nthat is what he tried to show. As he himself said, \"I will \\nprove it to you, gentlemen, and I will prove it in two \\nways. First, in the blinding clarity of the facts, and \\nsecond, in the dim light cast by the mind of this \\ncriminal soul.\" He reminded the court of my insensi\\xad\\ntivity; of my ignorance when asked Marnan1s age; of my \\nswim the next day-with a woman; of the Fernandel \\nmovie; and finally of my taking Marie horne with me. It \\ntook me a few minutes to understand the last part be\\xad\\ncause he kept saying \"his mistress\" and to me she was \\nMarie. Then he carne to the business with Raymon d.

I had \\nagreed with Raymond to write the letter in order to lure \\nhis mistress and submit her to mistreatment by a man \\n\"of doubtful morality.\" I had provoked Raymond\\'s ad\\xad\\nversaries at the beach. Raymond had been wounded. I \\nhad asked him to give me his gun. I had gone back \\nalone intending to use it. I had shot the Arab as I \\nplanned. I had waited.

He said the truth \\nwas that I didn\\'t have a soul and that nothing human , \\nnot one of the moral principles that govern men\\'s hearts, \\nwas within my reach. \"Of course,\" he added, \"we cannot \\nblame him for this.

He repeated what he had \\nsaid earlier in the proceedings. But it went on much \\nlonger than when he was talking about my crime-so \\nlong, in fact, that finally all I was aware of was how hot a \\nmorning it was.

He \\nthought that everything would go well and that I would \\nget off with a few years in prison or at hard labor. I \\nasked him whether he thought there was any chance of \\noverturning the verdict if it was unfavorable. He said \\nno.

The days had been \\nlong since she'd stopped writing. That evening I thought \\nabout it and told myself that maybe she had gotten \\ntired of being the girlfriend of a condemned man. It also \\noccurred to me that maybe she was sick, or dead. These \\nthings happen. How was I to know, since apart from our \\ntwo bodies, now separated, there wasn't anything to \\nkeep us together or even to remind us of each other? \\nAnyway, after that, remembering Marie meant nothing \\nto me.

He sat down on my bunk \\nand invited me to sit next to him. I refused. All the \\nsame, there was something very gentle about him. \\nHe sat there for a few seconds, leaning forward, \\nwith his elbows on his knees, looking at his hands.

He then \\nleaned back against the wall, hands Bat on his thighs. \\nAlmost as if .it wasn\\'t me he was talking to, he remarked \\nthat sometimes we think we\\'re sure when in fact we\\'re \\nnot. I didn\\'t say anything. He looked at me and asked, \\n\"What do you think?\" I said it was possible. In any \\ncase, I may not have been sure about what really did \\ninterest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn\\'t. \\nAnd it just so happened that what he was talking about \\ndidn\\'t interest me. \\nHe looked away and without moving asked me if I \\nwasn\\'t talking that way out of extreme despair. I ex\\xad\\nplained to him that I wasn\\'t despera te. I was just afraid, \\nwhich was only natural. \"Then God can help you,\" he \\nsaid. \"Every man I have known in your position has \\nII6 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 125}), Document(page_content='0 THE STR ANGER o \\nturned to Him.\" I acknowledged that that was their right. \\nIt also meant that they must have had the time for it. As \\nfor me, I didn\\'t want anybody\\'s help, and I just didn\\'t \\nhave the time to interest myself in what didn\\'t interest \\nme. \\nAt that point he threw up his hands in annoyance \\nbut then sat forward and smoothed out the folds of his \\ncassock. When he had finished he started in again, ad\\xad\\ndressing me as \"my friend.\" If he was talking to me this \\nway, it wasn\\'t because I was condemned to die; the way \\nhe saw it, we were all condemned to die.

He thought it was more than \\na man could bear. I didn\\'t feel anything except that he \\nII7 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 126}), Document(page_content='0 THE STR ANGER 0 \\nwas beginning to annoy me. Then I turned away and \\nwent and stood under the skylight. I leaned my shoulder \\nagainst the wall. Without really following what he \\nwas saying, I heard him start asking me questions \\nagain. He was talking in an agitated, urgent voice. I \\ncould see that he was genuinely upset, so I listened \\nmore closely. \\nHe was expressing his certainty that my appeal would \\nbe granted, but I was carrying the burden of a sin from \\nwhich I had to free myself. According to him, human \\njustice was nothing and divine justice was everything. I \\npointed out that it was the former that had condemned \\nme. His response was that it hadn\\'t washed away my sin \\nfor all that. I told him I didn\\'t know what a sin was. \\nAll they had told me was that I was guilty. I was \\nguilty, I was paying for it, and nothing more could be \\nasked of me. At that point he stood up again, and the \\nthought occurred to me that in such a narrow cell, if \\nhe wanted to move around he didn\\'t have many options. \\nHe could either sit down or stand up. \\nI was staring at the ground. He took a step toward me \\nand stopped, as if he didn\\'t dare come any closer. He \\nlooked at the sky through the bars. \"You\\'re wrong, my \\nson,\" he said. \"More could be asked of you. And it may \\nbe asked.\" \"And what\\'s that?\" \"You could be asked to \\nsee.\" \"See what?\\' \\nThe priest gazed around my cell and answered in a \\nvoice that sounded very weary to me. \"Every stone here \\nsweats with suffering, I know that.

But deep in my \\nheart I know that the most wretched among you have \\nseen a divine face emerge from their darkness. That is \\nthe face you are asked to see.\" \\nThis perked me up a little. I said I had been looking \\nat the stones in these walls for months. There wasn\\'t \\nanything or anyone in the world I knew better. Maybe \\nat one time, way back, I had searched for a face in them. \\nBut the face I was looking for was as bright as the sun \\nand the flame of desire-and it belonged to Marie.

He turned and walked over to the wall \\nand slowly ran his hand over it. \"Do you really love this \\nearth as much as all that?\" he murmured. I didn\\'t \\nanswer. \\nHe stood there with his back to me for quite a long \\ntime. His presence was grating and oppressive . I was \\njust about to tell him to go, to leave me alone, when all \\nof a sudden, turning toward me, he burst out, \"No, I \\nrefuse to believe you! I know that at one time or another \\nyou\\'ve wished for another life.\" I said of course I had, \\nbut it didn\\'t mean any more than wishing to be rich, \\nto be able to swim faster, or to have a more nicely shaped \\nI 19 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 128}), Document(page_content='0 THE ST RANGER 0 \\nmouth. It was all the same. But he stopped me and \\nwanted to know how I pictured this other life. Then I \\nshouted at him, \"One where I could remember this \\nlife!\" and that\\'s when I told him I\\'d had enough . He \\nwanted to talk to me about God again, but I went up \\nto him and made one last attempt to explain to him that \\nI had only a little time left and I didn\\'t want to waste \\nit on God. He tried to change the subject by asking \\nme why I was calling him \"monsieur\" and not \"father.\" \\nThat got me mad, and I told him he wasn\\'t my father; \\nhe wasn\\'t even on my side. \\n\"Yes, my son,\" he said, putting his hand on my \\nshoulder, \"I am on your side. But you have no way of \\nknowing it, because your heart is blind. I shall pray for \\nyou.\" \\nThen, I don\\'t know why, but something inside me \\nsnapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and I \\ninsulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me. \\nI grabbed him by the collar of his cassock. I was pour\\xad\\ning out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of \\nanger and cries of joy. He seemed so certain about every\\xad\\nthing, didn\\'t he? And yet none of his certainties was \\nworth one hair of a woman\\'s head. He wasn\\'t even sure \\nhe was alive, because he was living like a dead man. \\nWhereas it looked as if I was the one who\\'d come \\nup emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about \\neverything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life \\nand sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that \\nwas all I had. But at least I had as much of a hold on \\n120 ', metadata={'source': '/content/The_Stranger_Albert_Camus.pdf', 'page': 129}), Document(page_content=\"0 THE STRANGER 0 \\nit as it had on me. I had been right, I was still right, I was \\nalways right. I had lived my life one way and I could \\njust as well have lived it another. I had done this and I \\nhadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done \\nanother. And so? It was as if I had waited all this time \\nfor this moment and for the first light of this dawn to \\nbe vindicated. Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew \\nwhy. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd \\nlived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from \\nsomewhere deep in my future, across years that were \\nstill to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever \\nwas offered to me at the time, in years no more real than \\nthe ones I was living. What did other people's deaths \\nor a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the \\nlives people choose or the fate they think they elect \\nmatter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, \\nme and billions of privileged people like him who also \\ncalled themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't \\nhe see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only \\nprivileg ed people. The others would all be condemned \\none day. And he would be condemned, too. What would \\nit matter if he were accused of murder and then executed \\nbecause he didn't cry at his mother's funeral? Sala\\xad\\nmano's dog was worth just as much as his wife. The \\nlittle robot woman was just as guilty as the Parisian \\nwoman Masson married, or as Marie, who had wanted \\nme to marry her.

Couldn\\'t he, couldn\\'t this \\ncondemned man see ... And that from somewhere deep \\nin my future ... All the shouting had me gasping for \\nair. But they were already tearing the chaplain from my \\ngrip and the guards were threatening me. He calmed \\nthem, though, and looked at me for a moment without \\nsaying anything. His eyes were full of tears. Then he \\nturned and disappeared. \\nWith him gone, I was able to calm down again. I \\nwas exhausted and threw myself on my bunk. I must \\nhave fallen asleep, because I woke up with the stars in \\nmy face. Sounds of the countryside were drifting in. \\nSmells of night, earth, and salt air were cooling my \\ntemples. The wondrous peace of that sleeping summer \\nRowed through me like a tide. Then, in the dark hour \\nbefore dawn, sirens blasted. They were announcing \\ndepartures for a world that now and forever meant noth\\xad\\ning to me. For the first time in a long time I thought \\nabout Maman. I felt as if I understood why at the end \\nof her life she had taken a \"fiance,\" why she had \\nplayed at beginning again. Even there, in that home \\nwhere lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wist\\xad\\nful respite. So close to death, Maman must have felt \\nfree then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody \\nhad the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it \\nall again too.

He spent the early years of his life \\nin North Africa, where he worked at various jobs-in \\nthe weather bureau, in an automobile-accessory firm, in \\na shipping company-to help pay for his courses at the \\nUniversity of Algiers. He then turned to journalism as \\na career.

During World \\nWar II he was one of the leading writers of the French \\nResistance and editor of Combat, then an important \\nunderground newspaper. Camus was always very ac· \\ntive in the theater, and several of his plays have \\nbeen published and produced. His fiction, including \\nThe Stranger, The Plagu e, The Fall, and Exile and \\nthe Kingdom; his philosophical essays, The Myth of \\nSisyphus and The Rebel; and his plays have assured \\nhis preeminent position in modern French letters.
